# CP JVM
A test that could become the next CP App Template

## Usage
First, fork this repo to work on your own :
<a href="https://github.com/TheRainbowPhoenix/CPAppTemplate/fork">
  <img src="docs/fork_repo.png" alt="Click that Fork button"/>
</p>

Find a cool name for it :
<a href="https://github.com/TheRainbowPhoenix/CPAppTemplate/fork">
  <img src="docs/fork_name.png" alt="Choose a name, then click Create fork"/>
</p>

Forking will take a few seconds.

Once done, open the forked repo on a codespace :
<p>
  <img src="docs/open_codespace.png" alt="Code > Codespaces > Create codespace on master"/>
</p>

You'll see a message telling it's creating, please wait for a while


<p>
  <img src="docs/create_container.png" alt="Wait for the codespace to be created"/>
</p>


On the terminal, use `make hhk` to generate an HHK file, or `make bin` to generate an BIN (smaller) that's both ready to get uploaded to your calculator

<p>
  <img src="docs/make_bin.png" alt="Run make hhk on the terminal to generate binaries"/>
</p>

You can now download generated files. If you run into issues during this step, please see [Getting support](#getting-support)

<p>
  <img src="docs/download_binary.png" alt="Download the files to upload to your calculator"/>
</p>

Plug your calculator on your desktop and choose "USB Flash" mode.
<p>
  <img src="docs/cp_usb_flash.png" alt="choose USB Flash on your calculator"/>
</p>


Go into your file explorer, on the "USB Drive" that's the calculator, and then copy at the root of it your `app_template.hhk` (or/and `app_template.bin`)
Then, eject the Classpad Mass Storage device by right clicking on notifications > "Safely remove device

Finally on your calculator, go in "System" from the home screen, "System" from the top menu and "Hollyhock-2 Launcher"
You should see the "My app name" on the list (twice if you did both the HHK and the BIN) and you can "Run" it
<p>
  <img src="docs/run_your_app.png" alt="You can run your app by clicking Run"/>
</p>

You should then see a beautiful demo with "Hello world" and custom shapes on the screen ! Congratulations !

## What to do next

You can edit the `main.cpp` file to add your own logic and build whatever you want. Be sure to remember that you're coding on embed hardware, and most of the C/C++ funtion you know won't work there (say `printf`).

First thing you can do is edit the first lines that describe your app :
```
APP_NAME("My app name")
APP_DESCRIPTION("A short description of my app")
APP_AUTHOR("My name")
APP_VERSION("1.0.2")
```

Then, you can take a look at the [beginners tutorials](#TODO) to build some simple programs and even small games.

For more information, you can explore the [docs](https://classpaddev.github.io/) or get some inspiration by looking at the [demos](#TODO)

## Why is there HHK and BIN
Design decisions made us split between ELF-compatible "hhk" and raw executable binary (or shellcode, kinda) "bin"
